A lot of programming is merely translation between different structures. So, let's make that as painless as possible. TS-Mutations provides a simple syntax that lets you focus on behavior, rather than wrangling types. 

It exposes two concepts, `KeyValues` (for objects), and `Collections` for arrays. 

For examples of usage, check out the [tests](test)
